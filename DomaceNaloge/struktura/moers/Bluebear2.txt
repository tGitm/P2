I now did something unprecedented: I took a breather.
No, not a pause for effect but a proper breather - a coffee break, so to speak.
It had occurred to me that I still had a sandwich in my pocket.
Chemluth had packed it so that I could fortify myself before the duel, but I'd forgotten all about it in my agitation.
I ceremoniously unwrapped the sandwich and proceeded to eat it.

The audience groaned and muttered.
Smyke excitedly conferred with his advisers.
Chemluth had pulled his cap down over his face.
Although no intermissions were allowed for during a Duel of Lies, they were not expressly prohibited.
I had discovered a loophole in the regulations.

I blithely continued to eat, chewing each mouthful seven times and pausing now and then - inserting breaks in the break, as it were.
No one in the history of the Zamonian entertainment industry had ever dared to tease an audience in this manner.
