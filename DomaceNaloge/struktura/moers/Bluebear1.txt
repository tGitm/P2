Between classes we loitered in the gloomy tunnels or killed time in our bleak, windowless rooms.
Occasionally we ventured out on to the ledge in front of the entrance to the Nocturnal Academy, where Mac had dropped me.
We never lingered, however, because conditions at that altitude were extremely cold and windy even in summer.
We simply stood there drawing in deep draughts of air until we developed hallucinations.
Once we had satisfied our need for oxygen we retired to the gloomy maze of tunnels.
We took no physical exercise, which Professor Nightingale thought absolutely pointless.
He held that all forms of sport killed off essential brain cells.

‘Every overdeveloped muscle has a major intellectual achievement on its conscience,’ was his considered opinion.
